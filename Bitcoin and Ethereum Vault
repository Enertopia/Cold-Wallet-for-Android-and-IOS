// Connect to Bitcoin and Ethereum exchanges to allow buying, selling and trading 
// Partner with a payment processor to accept fiat currency

// Allow users to import existing wallets using private keys or seed phrases
// Give users full access to their actual funds

// Implement BIP39 mnemonics and hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets for Bitcoin 
// Generate many addresses from a single seed phrase for improved privacy 

// Provide an advanced web interface for desktop access
// Include transaction history, address labels, account management, push notifications, etc.

// Sign actual Bitcoin and Ethereum transactions to send and receive real funds 
// Handle scaling and load testing to support many users and transactions

// Use AES-256 encryption to encrypt private keys and seed phrases 
// Encryption should be at rest and in transit for maximum security

// Have professional audits done to review the codebase and cryptography 
// Offer bug bounties to find and fix any vulnerabilities
// Make the app open-source but also provide strong security guarantees

// Clearly brand and market the app as a secure Bitcoin and Ethereum wallet
// Target crypto holders and traders, not just as a demo or concept

// Support additional security features like 2FA, address whitelisting, 
// device locking, etc. to protect user funds

// Generate new wallet 
if (walletType == WALLET_TYPE_BITCOIN) {
    seedPhrase = generateSeedPhrase();  // Generate BIP39 mnemonic seed phrase 
} else if (walletType == WALLET_TYPE_ETHEREUM) {
    privateKey = generatePrivateKey();  // Generate random private key
}

// Display seed phrase or private key to user and prompt to record
// Allow user to choose to disable manual recording prompt if desired

// Encrypt seed phrase or private key and store in Android KeyStore
if (walletType == WALLET_TYPE_BITCOIN) {
    encryptAndStoreSeedPhrase(seedPhrase);  
} else if (walletType == WALLET_TYPE_ETHEREUM) {
    encryptAndStorePrivateKey(privateKey);
}

// ... Additional methods for exchange connectivity, web interface, 
// transaction signing, security features, scaling, etc.
